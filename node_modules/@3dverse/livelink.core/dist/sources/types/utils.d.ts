/**
 * A dummy type to enforce the instantiation of a type alias of a native type, such as `string` or `number`.
 * This is only to ensure that the alias type shows up in the generated documentation and in autocomplete.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * type UUID = string;
 * ```
 * A variable of type `UUID` will show up as `string` in the documentation.
 * ```ts
 * type UUID = NativeType<string>;
 * ```
 * A variable of type `UUID` will show up as `UUID` in the documentation.
