# Livelink Core Library

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@3dverse%2Flivelink.core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@3dverse%2Flivelink.core)

## Overview

The **Livelink protocol** enables communication between a client and a 3dverse server using a message-based, binary format. This protocol evolves alongside server updates, necessitating a dynamically loaded implementation rather than embedding it directly in client applications.

This package, the **Livelink Core library**, provides:

-   Minimal code to dynamically load the full library from a CDN.
-   TypeScript type definitions for protocol integration.

## How It Works

The **Livelink Core library** package primarily offers TypeScript type definitions. The only functional code it includes is the `DynamicLoader` module, which dynamically retrieves the remaining library code from the CDN.

### Key Features:

-   Always loads an up-to-date version of the Livelink protocol.
-   Ensures **forward compatibility** for all client applications.

By dynamically loading the library, this system guarantees smooth communication with the server, regardless of server-side updates.

## Usage

> **âš  Warning: This library is not meant for direct use.**
> Refer to the [@3dverse/livelink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@3dverse/livelink) package for a practical implementation.

### Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
npm install @3dverse/livelink.core
```

### Loading the Library

Import the DynamicLoader module:

```typescript
import { DynamicLoader } from "@3dverse/livelink.core";
```

Before using any other features, call the load static method:

```typescript
await DynamicLoader.load();
```

### Using the Core

Once the library is loaded, create a new instance of the core using the `Core()` static method:

```typescript
const core = new DynamicLoader.Core();
```

This instance contains the full implementation of the Livelink protocol.

## Protocol

A formal specification of the Livelink protocol is not yet published. The protocol primarily revolves around:

-   Commands: Instructions sent to the server.
-   Queries: Requests for information addressed to the server.
-   Events: Notifications received from the server.

Stay tuned for updates as the protocol evolves.
