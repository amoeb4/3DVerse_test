# Livelink.js

## About

Livelink.js is a **TypeScript** library that provides an implementation of the Livelink protocol.
The Livelink protocol is used to communicate with a 3dverse real-time rendering server.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @3dverse/livelink
```

## Usage

Note that we advise using the React wrapper [livelink.react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@3dverse/livelink-react) for a more developer friendly experience.

If you're still interested in using the Livelink API directly, here's a quick guide on how to get started: [example](./example.md).

The reference documentation can be found at [https://docs.3dverse.com/livelink.js](https://docs.3dverse.com/livelink.js).
